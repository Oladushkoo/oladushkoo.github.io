              Pink lilies are predictable – they speak of the tenderness and romantic mood of the giver. It will be a good gift for either a young girl or an adult woman who wants to make a compliment as a warm, affectionate, kind and endearing person.

              Orange lilies look bright, look rich and optimistic - in fact, they are given as a wish for health and longevity. It is more than appropriate to give such a bouquet to a person who was ill, but is already on the way to recovery. There is no fading, fragility and vulnerability in it (and it is better not to show it to the sick even in the form of flowers, the subconscious mind works subtly), but there is motivation, mood, charging brightness.

              The blue plant speaks of destiny, of the turns of fate prescribed from above. That is, a bouquet of such lilies can mean acceptance: willingness to accept what is happening in life with gratitude, and work with what is. If you give examples, then forced relocation, dismissal, difficulties that cannot be fixed in one day - this is the reason to present a bouquet of blue or blue lilies to a loved one as a sign that we will cope anyway.</p>
